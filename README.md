# Shiny App: Simpson's Paradox

This shiny app illustrates the Simpson's paradox based on the cholesterol example in Glymour et al. (2016, Section 1.2.). The app is based on [this template for an Example Shiny App on Heroku](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-docker-r-shiny-app).

This app has been developed in the context of the project [Digital Causality Lab](https://digitalcausalitylab.github.io/) at the University of Hamburg.
